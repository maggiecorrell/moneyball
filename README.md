Goal: Put together the starting 9 player roster for a single season. How?

Find the players with the highest OBP and the lowest salary in any specific year.
Making sure there are no outliers (an OBP of 1.0 is not an indicator of a perfect player, more like they possibly only played 4 or 5 games and had good luck, alternatively an OBP of 0 is pretty bad). 

9 player roster will need to include:

- (1st, 2nd, 3rd) Baseman
- (Left, Center, Right) Fielders
- Short Stop
- Pitcher
- Catcher

A player that historically played multiple positions can not account for 2 places on your roster.
